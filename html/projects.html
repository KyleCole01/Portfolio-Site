        <h4> FRONT-END</h4>
        <p>I have built websites and single page applications using Figma for design and developing code with HTML5, CSS, LESS/SASS, Javascript, Bootstrap, jQuery, Redux, and React. My favorite front-end technology is by far React. I love its approach to constructing small, interchangeable, and reusable components which decrease development time while increasing productivity and scalability.</p>
        <h4>BACK-END</h4>
        <p>I have built servers utilizing Node.js and Express with RESTful api's for front-end applications. I have designed and managed databases in SQLite for development and PostgreSQL for production. My favorite libraries are Knex and Node.js! I appreciate the one language for everything paradigm, and I believe it is amazing you can write the front-end application, the API, and even the SQL Queries in Javascript.</p>
        <h4>Android</h4>
        <p>I have built several Android Applications and am very proficient with Java, Kotlin, Android SDK, Android Studio, and the Google Play Store</p>
